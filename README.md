# EGM126-CH-Assign-02

This VR environment is a simple representation of the temporary exhibition galleries at National Museum Wales in Cathays Park Cardiff. The model has been designed to evaluate how the ‘Evolution of Wales’ (EOW) exhibition currently situated in another gallery might be repackaged to fit into the temporary exhibition space. This is a personal interest and not a current project of the museum.
The gallery spaces are simply represented by walls and a plain floor to actual scale. Teleport & walk areas are marked by wood plank texture. I have used videos from the current EOW installation together with low-poly 3D animated assets to represent each of the six geological periods featured in the exhibition. The videos are at large scale to act a back-drops to the exhibits.

Interaction is limited to teleporting around the environment using the righthand grab switch to select areas in which to ‘teleport. There are no interactions other than each of the exhibits having a mesh collider component to prevent the user teleporting inside a rock, tree or dinosaur.
